# E-Commerce Sales Dashboard using Power BI

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates an **end-to-end business intelligence workflow** using **Microsoft Power BI** to analyze and visualize e-commerce sales data.

The objective of this project is to transform raw transactional data into a **professional, insight-driven dashboard** that helps stakeholders understand:

* Overall sales and profit performance
* Customer purchasing behavior
* Category and sub-category contribution
* Payment mode preferences
* Regional (state-wise) sales trends

This project simulates how **data analysts and BI developers** build dashboards for management reporting and decision-making.

## Business Problem

The business operates in the e-commerce domain with multiple product categories, customers, payment modes, and regions. Raw transactional data makes it difficult for stakeholders to quickly answer key business questions such as:

* How much sales and profit is the business generating?
* Which categories and sub-categories perform best?
* Which states contribute the most to revenue?
* What payment modes are preferred by customers?
* How does profit vary month by month?

Without a centralized dashboard, decision-making is slow and largely manual.

## Solution Approach

### Step 1: Data Import and Understanding

* Imported raw e-commerce sales data into **Power BI Desktop**
* Reviewed data structure, columns, and data types
* Identified key dimensions and measures for analysis

---

### Step 2: Data Transformation (Power Query)

Performed data cleaning and transformation using **Power Query Editor**:

* Removed unnecessary columns
* Fixed data types
* Handled missing and inconsistent values
* Renamed columns for clarity
* Ensured data quality for reporting

---

### Step 3: Data Modeling

* Created relationships between fact and dimension tables
* Ensured proper cardinality and filter direction
* Optimized the model for dashboard performance

---

### Step 4: DAX Measures Creation

Created key measures using **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**:

* Total Sales Amount
* Total Profit
* Total Quantity Sold
* Average Order Value (AOV)

These measures enable dynamic calculations across all visuals and filters.

---

### Step 5: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed data directly through visuals to identify:

* Monthly profit trends
* Category-wise and sub-category-wise performance
* Customer contribution to total sales
* Payment mode distribution
* State-wise revenue concentration

---

### Step 6: Power BI Dashboard Development

Designed a **professional and interactive Power BI dashboard** with consistent color themes, KPIs, and visual hierarchy.

#### Dashboard KPIs

* Total Sales Amount
* Total Profit
* Total Quantity Sold
* Average Order Value (AOV)

#### Visualizations Included

* Profit by Month (Bar Chart)
* Sales by State (Bar Chart)
* Quantity by Category (Donut Chart)
* Profit by Sub-Category (Bar Chart)
* Sales by Payment Mode (Donut Chart)
* Sales by Customer (Bar Chart)
* Quarter-wise Slicer for dynamic filtering

## Key Insights

* Sales and profit vary significantly across months, indicating seasonality
* Clothing category contributes the highest quantity sold
* A small number of states generate the majority of sales revenue
* COD and UPI are the most preferred payment modes
* Certain sub-categories generate higher profit despite lower quantity sold
* A few customers contribute disproportionately to total sales
